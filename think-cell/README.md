Test assignment

Thank you for participating in our recruiting test. This will be a C++ programming test!
How to prepare for this test

Install an editor and C++ compiler of your choice. Your solution will be compiled with GCC 13.2.0 (with -std=c++20), and you'll have the chance to fix any compilation errors prior to submission. You may use the standard libraries for the task. You may not use other libraries. You won't need them anyway.

You are free in your choice of operating system and development environment. The task is a very general programming assignment testing general problem structuring and programming proficiency. You should do the test in one sitting, though of course you can take breaks as needed. We also recommend taking the time to thoroughly test your solution. Our top candidates often solve the problem in 3 to 4 hours. However, this is just a benchmark. Don't rush â€” we wouldn't give you this assignment if it was trivial.

You must develop the solution yourself. Do not let others help you, and do not search for existing solutions. Of course, you may use any documentation of the C++ language or the C++ Standard Library. Do not give your solution to others or make it public. It may entice others to send in plagiarized solutions, making our recruiting less fair. If you use an online compiler, make sure that the privacy settings are set to private. Publishing the task description is also considered cheating and will void your application.

The amount of code you'll need for a correct solution is relatively small, and you'll spend more time thinking than typing. We want to see the best solution you can come up with!
Task Description

interval_map<K,V> is a data structure that associates keys of type K with values of type V. It is designed to be used efficiently in situations where intervals of consecutive keys are associated with the same value. Your task is to implement the assign member function of this data structure, which is outlined below.

interval_map<K, V> is implemented on top of std::map. For more information on std::map, you may refer to cppreference.com.

Each key-value pair (k,v) in interval_map<K,V>::m_map means that the value v is associated with all keys from k (including) to the next key (excluding) in m_map. The member interval_map<K,V>::m_valBegin holds the value that is associated with all keys less than the first key in m_map.

Example: Let M be an instance of interval_map<int,char> where

    M.m_valBegin=='A',
    M.m_map=={ (1,'B'), (3,'A') },

Then M represents the mapping

    ...
    -2 -> 'A'
    -1 -> 'A'
    0 -> 'A'
    1 -> 'B'
    2 -> 'B'
    3 -> 'A'
    4 -> 'A'
    5 -> 'A'
    ...

The representation in the std::map must be canonical, that is, consecutive map entries must not contain the same value: ..., (3,'A'), (5,'A'), ... is not allowed. Likewise, the first entry in m_map must not contain the same value as m_valBegin. Initially, the whole range of K is associated with a given initial value, passed to the constructor of the interval_map<K,V> data structure.

Key type K

    supports copy and move construction, as well as copy and move assignment,
    is less-than comparable via operator<,
    does not implement any other operations, in particular no equality comparison or arithmetic operators.

Value type V

    supports copy and move construction, as well as copy and move assignment,
    is equality-comparable via operator==,
    does not implement any other operations.

You are given the following source code:

#include <map>
template<typename K, typename V>
class interval_map {
friend void IntervalMapTest();
V m_valBegin;
std::map<K,V> m_map;
public:
// constructor associates whole range of K with val
template<typename V_forward>
interval_map(V_forward&& val)
: m_valBegin(std::forward<V_forward>(val))
{}

    // Assign value val to interval [keyBegin, keyEnd).
    // Overwrite previous values in this interval.
    // Conforming to the C++ Standard Library conventions, the interval
    // includes keyBegin, but excludes keyEnd.
    // If !( keyBegin < keyEnd ), this designates an empty interval,
    // and assign must do nothing.
    template<typename V_forward>
    void assign( K const& keyBegin, K const& keyEnd, V_forward&& val )
    	requires (std::is_same<std::remove_cvref_t<V_forward>, V>::value)
    {


    }

    // look-up of the value associated with key
    V const& operator[]( K const& key ) const {
    	auto it=m_map.upper_bound(key);
    	if(it==m_map.begin()) {
    		return m_valBegin;
    	} else {
    		return (--it)->second;
    	}
    }

};

// Many solutions we receive are incorrect. Consider using a randomized test
// to discover the cases that your implementation does not handle correctly.
// We recommend to implement a test function that tests the functionality of
// the interval_map, for example using a map of int intervals to char.

Your task is to implement the function assign. Your implementation is graded according to the following criteria, in this order:

    Type requirements: You must adhere to the specification of the key and value type given above.
    Correctness: Your program should produce a working interval_map with the behavior described above. In particular, pay attention to the validity of iterators. It is illegal to dereference end iterators. Consider using a checking STL implementation, such as the one shipped with Visual C++ or GCC.
    Canonicity: The representation in m_map must be canonical.

    Running time: Imagine your implementation is part of a library and should therefore be big-O optimal:
        The assign function should have amortized time complexity of O(log N), where N is the number of elements in m_map.
        Minimize the number of copy-constructions and copy-assignments performed on K and V. Make use of std::forward where applicable.
        Only one operation may have amortized time complexity of O(log N). The rest must have amortized time complexity of O(1).
        Given the constraints above, avoid comparing K and V more often than necessary because you don't know how fast these operations are.
        Otherwise, favor simplicity over minor speed improvements.

Don't rush through the test. We wouldn't give you this assignment if it was trivial.

you like.
